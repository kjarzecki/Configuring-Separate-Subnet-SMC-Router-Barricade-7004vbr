            <p>This webpage will outline how to configure a separate subnet on your router.<br>
            The end goal will be to disconnect your laptop from wifi, and route the internet connection
            through the router, on a subnet different from the router default gateway IP.<br>
            In this example we will be configuring an SMC Barricade 7004vbr.<br>

    <p>Dave watched as the forest <b>burned</b> up on the <strong>hill,</strong>
        only a few miles from her house. 
        The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up 
        the last of the pets. <br> Dave went through his mental list of 
        the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. 
        He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped 
        that he had remembered everything that was needed. 
        <br> He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, 
        but she still was nowhere to be seen.</p><br>
